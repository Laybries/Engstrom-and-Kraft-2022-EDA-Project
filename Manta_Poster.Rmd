## Introduction

This

## Methods

We are using iNaturalist explain what it is and how it is collected. What did we do to get the data rNat package to get the data and how we filtered it.

## Results

You

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Discussion

You

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
