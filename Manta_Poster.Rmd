## **Using iNaturalist to Identify Breeding Locations of Manta Ray**

## Abstract

-   Manta ray migrate where the food is, which makes them hard to study

-   In addition, they are at risk from fisheries and bycatch (Stewart et al 2016)

-   Using iNaturalist data to see if there are migration patterns

-   Then identifying breeding grounds of two different species of manta ray

-   With this information we propose to make these sites protected grounds

## Introduction

-   Manta ray are an elusive species, juveniles have never been studied in the wild (Stewart et al 2018)

-   *Mobula birostris* (oceanic ray) and *Mobula alfredi* (reef ray) are both migratory species

-   Reef Rays typically have their mating season from October to January (Simpkins 2013)

-   Oceanic Rays are considered year round, but it depends on what waters they are in (Manta Ray Reproduction 2018)

-   We are working to identify breeding grounds to propose marine protected areas

## Methods

-   Using iNaturalist data, a citizen science program used to catalog sightings of organisms

-   Then cleaned up the data using rNat and tidyverse

-   We filtered the data to include species name, latitude, longitude, year, month, and day

-   Then made a map with the filtered data

## Results

-   Oceanic rays may have breeding grounds near the west coast of the US, Gulf of Mexico, New Zealand, Australia, and Indonesia

-   Reef rays may have breeding grounds near India in the Maldives and Indonesia

-   Reef rays have higher sightings in winter near India in the Maldives and Indonesia
