## Using iNaturalist to Identify Breeding Locations of Manta Ray

Abstract--Manta rays are the gentle giants of the ocean, but not much is known about the species. For instance, the juvenile stage has never been successfully studied in the wild. If we can pinpoint specific locations, then we can push to have those areas protected (Stewart et al 2018). We will use data from iNaturalist, a citizen science effort where individuals across the world can report sightings of all sorts of organisms. We will focus on two species, *Mobula birostris* (oceanic ray) and *Mobula alfredi* (reef ray). We will map sighitings of these species of their during their breeding season.
