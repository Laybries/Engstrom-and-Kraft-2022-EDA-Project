## EDA Manta Ray Migrations

Abstract--Manta rays are the gentle giants of the ocean, but not much is known about the species. For instance, the juvenile stage has never been successfully studied in the wild. If we can pinpoint specific locations, then we can push to have those areas protected (Stewart et al 2018). We are using data found in Inatualist, a program where individuals across the world can report sightings of all sorts of organisms. By narrowing down the species to Mobula birostris and Mobula alfredi, we hope to identify breeding grounds and potential feeding grounds. By using the date, the individual was spotted, and the latitude and longitude, for geographical location.
